 *
 * Calls `payments.user_capabilities(target_user_id)` — a SECURITY
 * DEFINER RPC that wraps the underlying view. We do **not** trust the
 * JWT `user_capabilities` claim here: the claim is a UI hint (so the
 * frontend can hide buttons without a roundtrip) but it is baked into
 * the access token until it expires, so a subscription that cancels
 * would still appear active until the next refresh. By querying the
 * DB on every call, the next gated call after a status change
 * immediately gets the right answer.
 *
 * The RPC is the canonical public API; the underlying
 * `payments.user_capabilities_v` view is internal (revoked from
 * authenticated) so a future contributor cannot bypass the RPC's
 * per-user gate by querying the view from a supabase-js client. The
 * RPC itself rejects authenticated callers that query another
 * user's id with a 42501, providing an additional belt-and-suspenders
 * check on top of the cascading RLS of the underlying tables.
 *
 * Role bypass: callers whose `role` is `admin` or `tester` skip the DB
 * call entirely. Staff and developers can exercise any gated feature
 * without holding a subscription; the bypass is logged at info level
 * so observability can distinguish staff-granted access from
 * subscription-granted access.

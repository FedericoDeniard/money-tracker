/**
 * The set of features that are gated by role. THIS MAP IS THE SINGLE
 * SWITCH for role-based gating on the backend (Deno edge functions).
 *
 * This is a duplicate of `packages/frontend/src/lib/features.ts#FEATURES`.
 * The two copies must stay in sync — the public.app_role enum in
 * Postgres is the authority on the role vocabulary, but there is no
 * authority for the FEATURES map itself; keep this file in lockstep
 * with the frontend copy whenever a feature is added or its required
 * role is changed.
 *
 * The values here are consulted by `requireMinRole` in `_shared/auth.ts`:
 * every user-facing edge function calls `requireMinRole(auth, "<key>", ...)`
 * and the helper looks up the required role from this map.
 *
 * Today every value is `"user"` so the middleware accepts every caller.
 * The moment a value is raised to `"tester"` or `"admin"`:
 *
 *   - every edge function that calls `requireMinRole(auth, "<key>", ...)`
 *     starts returning 403 for callers below that role, with the
 *     error message "Requires role '<required>'".
 *   - the frontend classifier (`utils/edge-function-errors.ts`)
 *     substitutes the localized "This is a premium feature" toast.
 *
 * No other code changes are needed to gate a feature — flip the value
 * in BOTH this file and the frontend copy, commit, deploy.

/**
 * Subscription status vocabulary for the frontend.
 *
 * Single source of truth for "is this subscription currently paying
 * us?". Mirrored in:
 *   - `supabase/functions/_shared/capabilities.ts` (server-side auth gate)
 *   - `supabase/migrations/20260705143044_add_default_capabilities_and_view.sql`
 *     (the WHERE clause in `payments.user_capabilities_v`)
 *   - `packages/frontend/src/pages/AccountBilling.tsx` (Cancel button visibility)
 *
 * Statuses that grant entitlements. A user with a subscription in
 * any of these statuses keeps their capabilities until the status
 * leaves the set (e.g. via a webhook updating `cancelled` or
 * `payment_failed`).
 *
 * The constant is exported as a `Set` (O(1) lookup) for the runtime
 * checks and as a tuple (for type derivation). If a new status is
 * ever added in `payments.subscriptions.status`, this file is the
 * one to update; the runtime check in `assertSubscriptionStatusSync`
 * will surface the drift as a console warning instead of silently
 * misclassifying the user.

 * without waiting for a JWT refresh — same contract as
 * `supabase/functions/_shared/capabilities.ts#requireCapability`.
 *
 * Returns `{ allowed: true }` when the caller has the capability on
 * any active subscription (or as a default grant, or when their role
 * is in the bypass set); `{ allowed: false, missing: capability }`
 * otherwise. The caller decides how to surface a denial (the chat
 * handler in `routes/resilient-chat-route.ts` returns a 403 with the
 * same `Requires capability: <key>` prefix the frontend classifier
 * matches against, so the user sees the localized "premium feature"
 * toast via `getEdgeFunctionErrorMessage`).
 *
 * The mirror of this helper in the supabase edge functions uses the
 * service-role Supabase client; the mastra-server uses a per-request
 * client scoped to the caller's JWT (built from `supabaseToken` in
 * the request context) so RLS still applies and we don't need
 * service-role credentials in this package. The RPC is SECURITY
 * DEFINER so it can read payments.user_capabilities_v (which is
 * revoked from authenticated) on behalf of the caller's JWT.
